</ul>

## Withdrawal Sync Times

Transactions are regularly synced every 15 minutes to ensure that all transaction data is up-to-date unless the Sync withdrawals button is clicked. If the Sync withdrawals button is clicked, transactions update in that real time and again start syncing every 15 minutes afterwards.

## Current Balances at a Glance

On the top of the withdrawals page you can see the current balance available and sync of the balance according to the time as shown in the image below. If the withdrawal is more than the current balance for the particular company even after you click the Sync balances button then let the executive or manager know so that it will be debited.

These balances are updated dynamically to reflect real-time financial movements and can be manually synced using the "Sync balances" function.

## Pending Withdrawals

When a client requests a withdrawal, it initially appears in the "Pending Withdrawals" section if the client is not marked as "Do Not Pay." This section is crucial for monitoring and processing client withdrawal requests efficiently.

Steps for Managing Pending Withdrawals:
Review the Withdrawal Request:
Navigate to the "Pending Withdrawals" tab where you will see the list of pending requests.
Each entry typically displays client details and the requested amount.
Initial Checks:
Check for any warnings or payment notes associated with the withdrawal. These are usually indicators of special circumstances or issues related to the withdrawal.
Click on the "View More" button to access detailed information about the client, such as the required turnover multiplier and the remaining turnover necessary for the withdrawal.
Verification of Turnover:
Ensure that the "Remaining T/o for Withdrawals" is zero, indicating that the client has met all the betting requirements necessary for their withdrawal. Exceptions should only be made if there are reasonable and justifiable circumstances.
Processing the Withdrawal:
If all conditions are met and there are no discrepancies, click the "Process" button. This action will move the withdrawal request to the "Processing Withdrawals" tab, where it will be finalized.
Handling Discrepancies:
If you discover any issues, such as the required turnover not being zero or other related problems, click the "Cancel" button.
You will be prompted to select a reason for cancellation from a list of predefined options. Choose the most appropriate reason that explains why the withdrawal cannot be processed.
Communication with the Client:
If "Send SMS" is checked at the time of cancellation, a copy of the cancellation reason will be automatically sent to the client via SMS. This ensures transparency and keeps the client informed.
If you prefer not to send an SMS notification, simply uncheck the "Send SMS" box before finalizing the cancellation.

## Processing Withdrawals

Once a withdrawal request has been approved in the "Pending Withdrawals" tab, it moves into the "Processing Withdrawals" section. This stage is crucial for ensuring that each withdrawal is executed smoothly and efficiently.
Steps for Processing Withdrawals
Monitoring the Process:
After a withdrawal request moves to the "Processing" stage, it is typically processed within a minute if all the details such as bank account and client name are correct.
Monitor the transactions to ensure they transition smoothly from "Processing" to "Complete Withdrawals".
Handling Delays:
Occasionally, even if all details are correct, a withdrawal may remain in the "Processing" tab longer than expected. This could be due to various operational or technical issues.
If a withdrawal seems delayed and the client has not received their funds, conduct a detailed check.
Verifying Transactions:
Use the client’s PIN, name, or account number to check the web dosh transactions. Look for the transaction matching the exact amount requested by the client.
Compare the transaction times and details. If no matching transaction is found, there may be a need for manual intervention.
Manual Payment:
If a discrepancy is noted and the transaction is not processed automatically, access the manual payment system via Control.
Once on the Control site, execute the payment manually and ensure that the transaction is completed.
Finalizing the Process:
After manually processing the payment, click on the "Paid Manually" button in the system. This action will move the transaction to the "Complete Withdrawals" tab.

## Complete Withdrawals

The "Complete Withdrawals" section lists all the transactions that have been successfully processed and completed.
This tab provides comprehensive details of each withdrawal, including the amount withdrawn, the method of payment, and other relevant information.
Monitoring this tab helps ensure transparency and accuracy in the record of completed transactions, serving as a confirmation that funds have been successfully transferred to the client’s account.
